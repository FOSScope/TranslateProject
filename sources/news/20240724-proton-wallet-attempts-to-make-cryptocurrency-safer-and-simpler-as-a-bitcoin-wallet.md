Now, you can keep your bitcoins safe with Proton Wallet.

[Proton](https://proton.me/) has been busy this year. They have been at it, pushing upgrades to their existing services by adding new functionality and addressing issues.

A week after adding an [open-source AI writing assistant](https://news.itsfoss.com/proton-mail-ai-assistant/) to their Mail service, they have yet again introduced a new tool to further bolster their privacy-focused suite of apps and services.

The new service is called ‚Äú**Proton Wallet**‚Äù and is aimed at users of [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin).

&lt;img alt&#x3D;&quot;an illustration showing off multiple screenshots of proton wallet&quot; height&#x3D;&quot;1080&quot; width&#x3D;&quot;1920&quot; /&gt;\&lt;img src&#x3D;&quot;https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/07/Proton\_Wallet.jpg&quot; class&#x3D;&quot;kg-image&quot; alt&#x3D;&quot;an illustration showing off multiple screenshots of proton wallet&quot; loading&#x3D;&quot;lazy&quot; width&#x3D;&quot;1920&quot; height&#x3D;&quot;1080&quot; srcset&#x3D;&quot;https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/Proton\_Wallet.jpg 600w, https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/Proton\_Wallet.jpg 1000w, https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/Proton\_Wallet.jpg 1600w, https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/07/Proton\_Wallet.jpg 1920w&quot; sizes&#x3D;&quot;(min-width: 720px) 720px&quot;\&gt;

Rolled out in a limited, early access manner, **Proton Wallet is a self-custodial wallet for storing Bitcoin**, with Proton&#x27;s well-known end-to-end-encryption tech [safeguarding it](https://proton.me/blog/proton-wallet-security-model).

As for what a self-custodial wallet is. It ensures that a user doesn&#x27;t lose control over their encryption keys, allowing them to **not lose access to their Bitcoin or their digital assets**.

&lt;img alt&#x3D;&quot;proton wallet setup&quot; height&#x3D;&quot;667&quot; width&#x3D;&quot;921&quot; /&gt;\&lt;img src&#x3D;&quot;https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/07/proton-wallet-setup.jpg&quot; class&#x3D;&quot;kg-image&quot; alt&#x3D;&quot;proton wallet setup&quot; loading&#x3D;&quot;lazy&quot; width&#x3D;&quot;921&quot; height&#x3D;&quot;667&quot; srcset&#x3D;&quot;https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/proton-wallet-setup.jpg 600w, https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/07/proton-wallet-setup.jpg 921w&quot; sizes&#x3D;&quot;(min-width: 720px) 720px&quot;\&gt;

In this case, even if Proton as an organization were to go shut down, a user&#x27;s wallet would be safe, in contrast to the many horror shows we have seen in recent times (*read* [*FTX*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_FTX)).

During the launch, Director of Engineering at Proton, [Dingchao Lu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dingchaolu/) added that:

&gt; Proton has experienced first-hand the dangers of the traditional financial sector. In 2014 PayPal temporarily froze our assets and nearly ended Proton before it even got started.

&gt; That moment has stayed in our minds ever since and with the launch of Proton Wallet we want to reduce the world‚Äôs dependence on centralized financial institutions.

&gt; By giving users control of their own encryption keys and their own digital assets, we‚Äôre offering financial freedom, improved privacy and safety to millions of people around the world.

**Some key features** of this wallet include things like having an **open-source/independently audited nature**, **allowing users to send/receive Bitcoin via Email**, and **enabling users to buy Bitcoin in over 150 countries**, thanks to integration with licensed third parties.

The user interface looks pretty sleek in my opinion:

&lt;img alt&#x3D;&quot;proton wallet web&quot; height&#x3D;&quot;1053&quot; width&#x3D;&quot;1596&quot; /&gt;\&lt;img src&#x3D;&quot;https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/07/proton-wallet-bitcoin-wallet.jpg&quot; class&#x3D;&quot;kg-image&quot; alt&#x3D;&quot;proton wallet web&quot; loading&#x3D;&quot;lazy&quot; width&#x3D;&quot;1596&quot; height&#x3D;&quot;1053&quot; srcset&#x3D;&quot;https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/proton-wallet-bitcoin-wallet.jpg 600w, https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/proton-wallet-bitcoin-wallet.jpg 1000w, https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/07/proton-wallet-bitcoin-wallet.jpg 1596w&quot; sizes&#x3D;&quot;(min-width: 720px) 720px&quot;\&gt;

There&#x27;s also support for **two-factor authentication**, and a possibility of **adding support for other currencies**. But, that depends on the feedback they receive from users after the full launch. At launch, only Bitcoin will be supported.

Proton has also mentioned that **in the near future they will be offering a Proton Wallet Plus plan** that will come equipped with their [Proton Sentinel](https://proton.me/blog/sentinel-high-security-program) protection program for particularly vulnerable users such as activists, journalists, executives, etc.

For more details on all of this, refer to the [announcement blog](https://proton.me/blog/proton-wallet-launch).

**Proton Wallet will be limited to the users of the Proton Visionary plan and Lifetime plan**. Those users can then choose to invite other people to try out Proton Wallet.

For the rest of us, we will either have to sign up for the waitlist for a chance at getting early access, or simply wait it out until they fully launch it.

In any case, users with or without access can head to the [official website](https://proton.me/wallet) to get additional information on that and sign up for the waiting list.

*üí¨ What do you think of this Bitcoin wallet? Should competitors be worried?*
