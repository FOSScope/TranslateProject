The Free Software Foundation is turning 40 soon, and its new logo fits the occasion perfectly.

<!-- more -->

The Free Software Foundation (_FSF_) is the cornerstone of the free software movement that advocates for software freedom and the development and use of free (_as in freedom_) software.

Founded by Richard Stallman in 1985, the FSF undertakes a wide array of work, including maintaining the GNU operating system, managing the GNU General Public License, spearheading free software activism, and much more.

On October 4, 2025, the organization will celebrate its 40th anniversary, and to mark this milestone, the FSF team has unveiled a new commemorative logo.

## FSF's New Logo: What To Expect?

Selected from the FSF anniversary logo contest, the new one has been designed using GIMP to be in line with FSF's history, their work on the free software movement, and follows the strict guidelines laid out by the FSF team.

The selected logo is the work of JL, who had some tough competition from the submissions by Children's Design International Collection and Ivan. In the end, **JL's design came out ahead at a total of 120 votes** , with the other two having 42 and 56 votes, respectively.

If you ask me, the new logo—a silhouette of a flying bird set against the number 40—beautifully symbolizes the FSF's unwavering dedication to freedom and its commitment to the community over the past four decades.

It is set to adorn the various FSF webpages and printed materials for the upcoming 40th anniversary celebrations in Boston, MA. If you are around the area on that day, be sure to refer to the anniversary blog linked above for more details on the celebrations.
