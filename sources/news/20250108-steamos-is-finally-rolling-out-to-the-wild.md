[Handheld gaming consoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handheld_game_console) have seen a surge in popularity thanks to their portable nature, with devices now packing enough power to run games originally designed for computers and consoles.

[Valve](https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/) is one such organization that has capitalized on this trend, making a significant impact with their [Steam Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/) line of handhelds, which are equipped with [SteamOS](https://store.steampowered.com/steamos), an Arch Linux-based operating system designed specifically for gaming.

Now, they have introduced something that is set to further transform the handheld gaming scene.

**What's happening:** Coinciding with [CES 2025](https://www.ces.tech/), Valve has announced **its first-ever officially licensed handheld console**, the Lenovo Legion Go S, which ships with SteamOS.

It is a performance-focused handheld designed to deliver an optimized gaming experience that combines the power and flexibility of a PC for gamers on the go.

However, Valve is not stopping there. They have stated that **they are working on improving compatibility with other handhelds** while introducing support for more devices.

Valve also intends to release **a beta version of SteamOS** that is set to arrive before the Legion Go S ships 🔥

**What To Expect:** For starters, the fully-fledged SteamOS experience as found on the Steam Deck. With access to **thousands of games on Steam**, an optimized user interface for controller use, game recording, cloud saves, and the **freedom to install software** via the desktop.

(**Source: Lenovo**)

As for the **key specs** of the Lenovo Legion Go S, it features:

* **Battery:** 3-cell 55.5 Whr.
* **RAM:** Up to 32 GB LPDDR5X @ 6400 MHz.
* **APU:** [AMD Ryzen Z2 Go](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/handhelds/ryzen-z-series/z2-series/z2-go.html) or [AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/handhelds/ryzen-z-series/z1-series/z1-extreme.html).
* **Storage:** Up to 1 TB PCIe Gen4 SSD (*2242 or 2280 module*).
* **Display:** 8″ WQXGA LCD @ 120 Hz, max resolution 1920 × 1200.

**Where To Get:** If you liked what you saw, then you will have to wait a bit before you can get your hands on it. At the time of writing, the SteamOS variant of the Legion Go S was not listed on the [official website](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/), and [according to Lenovo](https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-legion-unleashes-next-gen-gaming-power-at-ces-2025/), **it will be available starting May 2025**, with an expected price tag of **$499.99**.

Personally, I’m excited to see an officially licensed SteamOS handheld, especially since the Steam Deck isn’t available in my region. This gives me hope of owning a SteamOS-powered handheld console someday.

And, not to forget, just the availability of SteamOS on more devices and a beta release makes me excited!

You can go through the [official announcement](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/529834914570306831) if you would like to learn more, and if you are interested in seeing how the SteamOS variant of the Lenovo Legion Go S performs, you can give [Engadget's coverage](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/ces-2025-the-lenovo-legion-go-s-is-the-first-third-party-steamos-handheld-160001642.html) a read.

*💬 What about you? Are you excited to see SteamOS reach new horizons?*
