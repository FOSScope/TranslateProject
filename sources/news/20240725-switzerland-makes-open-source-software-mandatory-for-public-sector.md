A big boost to the open-source community and an inspiration to other public sectors!

<!-- more -->

Many governments around Europe have been trying to break free from the shackles of closed-source software by [moving away](https://news.itsfoss.com/german-state-ditches-microsoft/) from the various offerings by Big Tech, and other competing firms.

However, in a more wide-ranging move, [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland)'s government has implemented something truly unique that's rarely seen in today's [Big Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech)-dominated world.

Short for [EMBAG](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/fga/2023/787/de), the Federal Law on the Use of Electronic Means for the Fulfillment of Government Tasks was a landmark law passed back in 2023, which has recently been put into effect.

Under this, **all public sector government agencies are required to use open-source software**, with an additional obligation of open sourcing any source code developed by or for those agencies.

However, in cases where there might be conflicts with third-party rights, or security issues, the code may not be disclosed.

Moreover, under the same provisions of Article 9, **there's also a mechanism for allowing such public agencies to offer additional services** pertaining to maintenance, integration, infrastructure security, etc. for public benefit with appropriate payouts being made to cover such costs.

[Dr. Matthias Stürmer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthiasstuermer/), Head of the Institute for Public Sector Transformation at Bern University, is credited to being one of the loudest voices behind the need for such openness in the Swiss government.

During a conversation with [Open Source Observatory](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor/news/new-open-source-law-switzerland), he added that:

> *Switzerland's new 'public money public code' law is a great opportunity for government, the IT industry and society.*

> *All stakeholders benefit from this new regulation since the public sector can reduce vendor lock-in, companies can grow their digital business solutions, and taxpayers spend less on IT solutions and receive better services due to increased competition and innovation.*

If you want to dive deeper into how EMBAG came to be, you can go through Dr. Stürmer's [detailed blog](https://www.ti8m.com/de/blog/open-source-gesetz-schweiz), which is written in German. You can use your browser's translator to read it, or paste the contents into an online translation tool.
